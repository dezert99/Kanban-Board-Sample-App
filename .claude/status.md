Last Updated: September 10, 2025

## 📊 Overall Progress

**Completion**: 95% (16/17 tasks completed)  
**Status**: All core features implemented, comprehensive loading states, ready for deployment

## 🎯 Current Sprint

### Recently Completed
- [x] Enhanced loading states with skeleton UI
- [x] Task detail page loading skeleton
- [x] Column-specific empty states with CTAs
- [x] Filter state persistence in localStorage
- [x] Status pre-selection for task creation from columns

### Up Next
1. Final testing and deployment
2. Performance optimization if needed

## ✅ Completed Features

### Foundation
- [x] Project initialized with Next.js 14
- [x] TypeScript configured
- [x] Tailwind CSS setup
- [x] Dependencies installed (@dnd-kit, Zustand, date-fns, lucide-react)

### Core Features
- [x] Kanban board with 3 columns (Scheduled, In Progress, Done)
- [x] Task cards displaying all info (title, description, assignee, tags, due date, priority)
- [x] Drag and drop between columns (with @dnd-kit)
- [x] Filter by text/assignee/tags (real-time filtering)
- [x] Task detail page (dynamic route /task/[id])
- [x] Backlog/list view (/backlog route)
- [x] Create/Edit task modal (with status pre-selection)
- [x] Inline editing for task details
- [x] Task deletion with confirmation

### Polish
- [x] Mobile responsive design (basic grid stacking)
- [x] Hydration error fixes (ClientOnly wrapper)
- [x] Date handling fixes (localStorage serialization)
- [x] Comprehensive loading/empty states with skeleton UI
- [x] Column-specific empty states with actionable CTAs
- [x] Task detail page loading skeleton
- [x] Enhanced task count loading indicators
- [x] Filter state persistence
- [x] Status pre-selection for task creation
- [x] Inline editing capabilities
- [x] Task deletion with dropdown menus

### Documentation
- [x] README.md created
- [x] Code comments added where needed
- [x] Architecture documented in CLAUDE.md
- [x] Task specifications documented
- [x] Implementation status tracked

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Bugs
- ✅ FIXED: Date serialization causing "getTime is not a function" errors
- ✅ FIXED: Hydration mismatch with drag-and-drop components
- ✅ FIXED: Infinite loop in BacklogView with getFilteredTasks()

### Technical Debt
- ✅ RESOLVED: Task modal fully implemented
- ✅ RESOLVED: Loading states are now comprehensive and polished
- Could add more comprehensive error boundaries (minor)
- Could add keyboard navigation (enhancement)

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### What's Working Well
- Drag and drop feels smooth and responsive
- Filter system works intuitively across both views
- Tailwind CSS v4 setup (after initial confusion)
- Type safety with strict TypeScript
- Navigation between board and list views is seamless

### Challenges Encountered
- Tailwind CSS v4 configuration (resolved with proper PostCSS setup)
- Hydration mismatches with @dnd-kit (solved with ClientOnly wrapper)
- Date handling in localStorage persistence (added proper serialization)
- Zustand store patterns for computed values (avoid infinite loops)

### Decisions Made
- Using Zustand for state management (simpler than Redux)
- @dnd-kit for drag and drop (better accessibility than react-beautiful-dnd)
- LocalStorage for persistence (sufficient for demo)
- App Router for routing (modern Next.js approach)
- ClientOnly wrapper for hydration-sensitive components

## 🚀 Deployment Status

**URL**: Not deployed yet  
**Platform**: Vercel (planned)  
**Environment**: Development (runs locally on port 3001)
